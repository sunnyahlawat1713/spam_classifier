# spam_classifier
Performing spam classification using various machine learning algorithms and comparing performances.
The machine learning models used are:
1. Multinomial Naive-Bayes Classifier
2. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
3. Logistic Regressor Classifier
4. Multi Layer Perceptron(MLP) Neural Network
5. Gradient Boosted Decision Trees 

For converting text into vectors for feeding into the classifiers , two vectorization techniques have been used:
1. Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (Tf Idf) Vectorization
2. Count Vectorization

Each of the five models have been trained using both these vectorization techniques successively and finally their performances have been compared
